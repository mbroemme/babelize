Features and functionality which should be added in the future.

    * Well no real feature but needs to be done. Testing, testing and
      more testing. Maybe there exist unknown bugs. :)
    * Create some check to prevent strange errors if we have not enough
      free diskspace to extract the language pack.

Look at the AUTHORS file if you want help me with 'babelize', or if
you have other interesting features which should be added.
