Introduction
============

'babelize' is an application and a framework to localize native
Linux games, for example that from Linuxgamepublishing or
Lokigames. 'babelize' uses a plugin architecture and after
installing the main application you need to install at least one
language pack to use it. :)

With 'babelize' you can localize many favorite Linux games with
many different languages, for example 'Heroes of Might an Magic III'
can be localized with 'Polish', 'German' or 'Spanish'.

Manual
======

Since first version the 'babelize' framework comes with a manpage
for every installed script. If you use 'babelize' first time it
is a good idea to read the `FAQ' file.
