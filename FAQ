Q: What is 'babelize'?
A: 'babelize' is an application and framework to localize native
   games for Linux.

Q: What is needed?
A: You need a working bash, coreutils, grep and xdelta.

Q: How can i localize a game?
A: If you want to localize a game one time you only need to download
   the language pack for your game. If you want to localize an
   already localized game you need additionally the original cd.

   incoming folder.

   Well i only can localize games if i have the cd with the language,
   for example: To create a german localized 'Heroes of Might and
   Magic III' i need the german windows version of the game. So contact
   me if you have a foreign language version of a native linux port.

Q: Are there any limitations or known problems?
A: I have never tested the language packs with newer xdelta above
   version 1.x.

Q: Why you are using delta files for localization?
A: The answer is that most of the original files on the cd are packed
   with proprietary archives.
