Changes version 1.1.1 (2008-06-10)
==================================

    * added support for multiple source media. (games like descent 3
      will need this)

    * added support for extra files which are not installed on full
      game installation but required for localization.

    * added support for patching different version of the same file.
      (files which are patched during game updates)

    * added support for patching optional files (files which are
      created during game updates)

    * added interactive media change mode.

Changes version 1.1.0 (2007-05-17)
==================================

    * switched to final language pack configuration file format (since
      1.1.0 'babelize' is able to localize real games)

    * added support for different source and target files to every
      copy and patch function.

    * added support for changing permissions after every copy and
      patch function.

    * added support for multiple versions of a patched file, to make
      language pack independent from future game updates.

Changes version 1.0.1 (2007-05-07)
==================================

    * added manpages for 'babelize' and 'babelize-config'

Initial version 1.0.0 (2007-04-17)
==================================

    * created a new plugin interface for babelize to make localizations
      independent from the binary version.

    * added support for checking the md5sum of the target files on which
      the xdelta files should be applied.

    * added support for dynamically parsing the script files and replace
      binary pathes at installation time.
